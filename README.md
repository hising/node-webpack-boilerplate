# Node Webpack React Express Mobx Boilerplate

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Fork of https://github.com/hising/node-webpack-boilerplate ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

## Goals

I have waisted hours of my life setting webpack, babel, express and react up with Hot Reloading and some basic features. I found https://github.com/hising/node-webpack-boilerplate which I liked (because it worked) but I do not like the design of Redux (prefer simpler solutions like mobx) and wanted to move to latest versions of React, Webpack etc. That is why I cloned this one. Goal is to build a tiny framework that I (or any other person) can use to get a working JS-only client-server stack up and running fast with some good (IMO) tools already setup. 

  * Only one running node process âœ…
  * Client-side React component hot reloading âœ…
  * Server-side React component hot reloading âœ…
  * Server-side express routes hot reloading âœ…
  * Client side [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) hot reloading âœ…
  * Using mostly ES6 module syntax, except where dynamic loading is needed âœ…
  * Client-side TypeScript support hot reloading
  * Data fetching through a remote API
  * Multiple pages via Routing
  * Mobx for state handling
  * Basic React Component Library from start https://onsen.io/react/
  * Jest testing out-of-the-box
  * Webpack Monitoring https://github.com/webpackmonitor/webpackmonitor
